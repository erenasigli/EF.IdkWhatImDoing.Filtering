Global filtering over all entities with some weird method for DBFirst 

Well, all filtering approaches already exists in tutorials are done with Code First approach. I need to filter data dynamically
and came up with that shitty solution.

Usage tips;

Create another partial class of your main dbcontext class which is generated by EF tools.
And also create a constructor and provide your filter value with a property. Such as;


     public BlaBlaEntities(int? appliedFilterID)
     : base("name=BlaBlaEntities")
        {
            if (appliedFilterID.HasValue)
            {
                this.FilterID = appliedFilterID.Value;
            }
        }

        public int FilterID { get; set; }

That way you can pass filter parameter optinally according to the method you like to filter.
Hope helps.
